- Inspiration:
	- Diablo 2
	- Runescape
	- Nuclear Throne
	- Binding of Isaac

- "Mini Diablo"
- Grid based DarkSouls, with zelda-esque room based combat
- Not so grid based anymore, still kind of though, free cardinal direction movement and attack at any angle
	- Top - down ish, almost a 3/4 view but with top down movement / attack like Binding of Isaac

- Design Pillars:
	- Every decision is a risk / reward, every action is a risk


- Each room is a challenge to open the next room
- Combat is timing based and spatial, few hits will kill. No drawn out fights (with normal enemies)
- Movement is grid based but smooth and real time (not any more)

- Combat consists of normal fast attack (shares one animationn) (melee)
- One special slow attack (depends on the weapon) (unique animation)
	- Or at maybe one animation with unique effects

- The hook is the loot
	- Each weapon you find has stats + one of (ideally quite a few) special attacks
	- Stats:
		- Attack speed
		- Attack length (how long before you gain movement back b/c attack locks you in place)
		- Damage
		- Weight / Interuption strength or something, to interrupt enemy attack

- Combat has the following mechanics:
	- Dodging = become invulnerable and move 1 or 2 squares in a direction
		- For avoiding attacks at last minute
	- Interrupting = some weapon are better then others at interupting an enemies attack, giving 
	the player more opening to attack
	- Weapon speed = Slow weapons mean you have to wait for an opening
	- Enemies attack cooldown = after they attack they sit still for some time. Some enemies are very
	fast and need to be interupted to get in some attacks
	- Stamina = Attacking and rolling use up stamina that doesnt regenerate until some time after
	the player doesnt use any. 
		- Without any stamina you cant roll or attack so it paces out combat

- Loot has the following mechanics
	- Damage reduction? Maybe lump into health
	- Bonus health (see above)
	- Stamina regeneration 
	- Bonus stamina
	- Maybe health regen (very rare if at all)
	- Roll distance?
	- Bonus damage	
	- Health potion efficacy
	- Colour to indicate rarity!

- Items: Each item is basically just a protrait and a few stats
	- Armor: how many peices yet to be decided, likely just 1
	- Weapon: also has a stat bonus or two: maybe elite ones have 2
		- Weapons also provide a special ability 
	- Maybe a trinket slot or something for an extra boost
	- Health potion
		- You can bring a set number with you into the dungeon
		- Buy them in the shoppe with gold earned in dungeon

- Special abilities:
	- Always combat focused
	- Take longer than normal attacks, unless its thing is that its fast
	- Does not animation character, does things in world like a line of spikes that come out of the ground

- Room mechanics:
	- A room is a descrete combat encounter, so each room needs to have an interesting combination
	- Enemy composition is always as a squad, and they fight as a squad to make it interesting
	- For instance there may be a healer in the group, and then some melee guys that you can either 
	out DPS the healing, or try to dodge melee guys and kill healer
	
	- Stretch Goal: Room can have a special puzzle or key room

- Enemies:
	- Enemies have tops one or two animations
	- A single species of enemy can be reskinned to make different classes like healer or melee guy 
	- Intuition says they should all move the same speed
	- Stats:
		- Health
		- Attack speed
		- Attack cooldown
		- Interuption resistance
	
- Enemy leaders:
	- Some groups (maybe every) has an enemy leader
	- Enemy leader has more health / does more damage (probably, may not need it)
	- Has a chance to drop loot (maybe always, since loot is already random)

- The Dungeon:
	- Rooms are connected in spatially consistent way to make up the floor in the dungeon
	- Doors lead to different rooms
	- Rare floors will have a treasure room, which you need the key to open
	- The key is elsewhere in the floor
	- You can only be in one room at a time, but should you be able to flee?
	- Some rooms have extra obsticles if thats interesting, like blocks you cant roll through and that
	block special attacks

	- One room on the floor contains the stairs down to the next floor
	- There are 5? floors per section of the dungeon
	- The 5th floor is a boss room

- Bosses / boss room:
	- Bosses have more than 1 attack, that can just be re-use of the special attacks from the player weapons
	- They take up more than one tile in the room, maybe composed of multiple animated parts
		- And have some big AOE
	- VERY IMPORTANT that they maintin the timing / avoiding based combat and not fall into boaring
	health sacks

- The metagame:
	- Each run you can flee with the equipment you are carrying, and save that equipment for another run
	- Otherwise you loose everything if you die
	- However if you flee you get to keep your gold
	- There is a store that stocks random weapons of varing rarity and one super rare random one
		- You can save up / farm gold in this way, and use it to buy weapons
	- You can also spend youre money on health potions (which you dont loose if you dont use them)
		- So you can farm easier levels to save up money to make longer runs easier
		- Or if youre pro you should be able to beat it with no health potions or super gear



- The overworld:
	- Little town (probably one screens worth)
	- Merchant sells items for gold (aquired in dungeon)
		- These are general purpose items / less rare items but are cheaper
		- In case you loose everything and need to gear up
	- Wizard sells health potions
		- Can buy up to your max stock
		- Maybe also buy higher stock with a bag of holding or something? Very expensive, may be interesting
	- Theif / dungeon raider
		- Little rat man that steal items from the depths
		- He will have one item at a time
			- Its always a rarer item and is more expensive
			- Maybe he has a chance of having one of the items you lost last time you died? Could be cool.
	- Well: This is where you enter the dungeon by climbing down a ladder

- Dungeon Levels:
	- The first dungeon has 5 level themes, which in turn are used 5 times each.
	1. Dank Sewers: filled with rats and spiders. Sewer themed rooms. Few combat mechanics other than 
	swarming enemeis
	2. Earthen Caverns: Caves filled with more rats, but also goblins and bears or something. Some 
	enemy team composition from the goblin, like an archer and some melee guys
	3. Deep City: Dwarves, which move slow but have healer and ranged attacks, as well as melee. Rooms
	have more complicated setups
	4. Catacombs: Skeletons and zombies. Mechanic is that killed enemies get back up once or twice, also
	have healers in the form of necromancer, need to comunicate which enemies get back up like with DS 
	white eyed / red eyed skeltons
	5. Hidden Lair: Demons that move around a lot in patterns and use lots of special attack. No plain melee,
	require lots of dodging to get in one attack

- Bosses:
	- A boss should be the culmination of getting through the level. The ultimate test of risk / reward
	- It doesnt have to give good loot, it just promises getting to the next layer with better loot
	
	1. Giant Rat: Charges aback and forth across the room. If you stand outside of his LOS he spews gas
	attack, making him unkillable until he charges and hits the wall. Then you attack from behind before he 
	gets up and spews gas again
	2. Goblin King: Has a bunch of reinforcements that he calls in, otherwise hes just a fairly tough goblin
	that tends to stand back	
	3. Jailed Beast: Another giant boss that smashes tiles with its fists from above. One attack does both 
	at same time and the other does a rapid succession of smashes. Each smash is signaled by shadow on tile.
	Have to get some attacks in then dodge fists, maybe attack fists to get rid of them?
	4. Forgotten Lich: Has some ranged skills that cause damage in lines out in front of him. Continuously 
	raises skeltons? Does a heal move where he stops moving and you have to out DPS the heal or the fight 
	will take a long time (with more skeletons). The skeletons die very easily though.
	5. Resurgent Demon: Darts in straight lines around the room trailing fire tiles that fade out. Have to bait 
	him into charging and roll out of the way at the last second, then run up behind and get a hit in. Also 
	has a very fast melee attack with a long cooldown

- Killing Final Boss:
	- Earns you a badge. You can see badges on your characer at the top of the screen or something? As a big 
	overlapping list to remind you how cool you are.

- More Metagame (Stretch goals with more scope)
	- Use badges to trade with other NPC in the village for some sort of meta game going on, like trying to 
	maximize your honour or impress as many people as possible? So show your badges to the right people? 
	- Needs more design work, needs to be an interesting economy with some sort of gameplay relevance to be
	interesting


- Looking At Design Holistically
	- Kill boss = Demon Skull
	- The more skulls you carry the lower your max health is
	- At any time in the dungeon you can flee back to the surface, loosing progress on your current run
	but saving all your items and gold
	- You can spend gold on more health potions and buying items / trinkets from the merchents
	- If you die in the dungeon you loose everything you are carrying
	- Returning to the surface adds the gold you collected to the total gold, that is not lost on death	
	- Carrying Skulls also increases drop rate of items from enemies
	
	- You can alternatively trade in Skulls on the surface to level up the merchants by granting them favour
	- Higher level merchants will have better items
		- Potion seller will unlock higher max carried potions

	- Alternatively you can add the skull to the skull pile as a sort of end game thing?
		- Could be as dumb as "Build a pile of skulls up to the sky to kill the god that cursed the town"
